This application allows the user to easilly view a dynamic flow of high quality photographs on their android device.

v1

- Supports Android 2.2 - 4.2
- Currently only supports editors choice images
- Memory used, seems to be around 20MB. Phones that cannot support application memory that high will overflow. (Not been tested for older devices)
- Clicking a image will display the image name and description in a toast

ToDo:

- Allow for other categories to be viewed like Upcoming or Fresh
- Create a single image viewer with more relative information regarding the image selected.
- Try and improve upward scrolling when viewing older pages. At the moment it seems to jump when scrolling while loading.
- Add more memory constraints relative the the individual device it runs on. Maybe have lower resolution images displayed to reduce
	bandwidth consumption as well as device resources
- Maybe store images locally on the device on the disk if they have been viewed before instead of redownloading them when needed
